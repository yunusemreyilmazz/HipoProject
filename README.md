# HipoProject
## A simple Android Kotlin Project with Nested JSON Parsing

* First of all I designed the application UI
* I created Hipo.json file in assets and copied all the given data in this file
* I used SearchView, ListView, EditText and a Button
* Filled ListView with data coming from Hipo.json file
* SearchView used for searching the given string in the ListView
* EditText for adding the new member to the ListView
* Press button for adding new member to the list 
* You can see the project details in this link:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tn-20facK1vZDWl8Nit6Vuh5V4_kyO5RTnVHup-3bYY/edit
